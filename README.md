<h1>Entanglement Medicine:</h1> 

Entanglement Medicine research uses the Ahronov-Bohm Effect, utilizing potential energy, to entangle different objects or spaces. This allows for non-local correlations (entanglement) and at the receiver to take potentials and produce real effects from those potentials. This experiment replicates the ability to copy information from one space in an aqueous solution to another space with a aqueous solution and replicate the structure from the original  The following references are for the 3 research groups that have been studied regarding using angular momentum to entangle remote objects: Kernbach, Persinger and Hu/Wu. The attempt at replicating these quantum effects are based on Persinger (2014) using a simple and low-cost toroidal coil for the Poynting Vector (AB effect) generator.  All three groups have reported using various Poynting Vector generators (Akimov, Lasers, LEDs) to show that there are remote metabolic changes between non-locally entangled objects.  For example, Persinger has shown that there is remote electron and proton interactions, where a remote site receives particles from another site, remotely, non-locally.
  
In the proposed replication test we propose using the toroidal coil used by Persinger et al before testing with Kernbach’s LED and Laser generators.  This allows a low-cost entry into the field to gain knowledge of the methods and techniques of Ahronov-Bohm engineering, with the initial application area in Infoceuticals- the remote distribution of pharmaceuticals, including vaccines directly from a central hub to mesh network recievers for direct administration to patents via aqueous compounds created from the original information of the entangled medicine at the central hub, this could also be customized for personalized medicine. 



<h3>Infoceuticals:</h3>

Infoceuticals is the information copy of medicinal substances non-locally to another object from the original, a copy of it's structural data through quantum entanglement to a target site. An overview is in this translation of a <a href="https://github.com/autonomous019/entanglement-medicine/blob/main/teleportation%20of%20vaccine%20properties.odt?raw=true">Teleportation Properties of Vaccines (Телепортация свойств вакцин) </a> by Krasnobryzhev V.G. (Краснобрыжев В.Г.) in 2009, these findings were confirmed in the experiments of Surinov et al (2017), also see the other research articles below validating this research area.  

Further research confirming this scientific transfer of medicinals has been conducted in Israel:

6. Studying the process of transferring medicinal properties to water medical supplies The idea of ​​the wave nature of energy-information exchange allowed to . t . n . M . M . Greenstein and Ph . m . n . M . M . Schreibman to develop a new perspective on the phenomenon homeopathy , supported by a series of experiments on a transfer apparatus
medicinal properties of medical preparations of the " Transfer " type.

As you know , in the process of dilution ( potentiation ) in intermediate solutions the concentration of the " material " component of the drug is significantly reduced , which , when ingested , could take part in various biochemical reactions . At high dilution levels, the material component of the drug practically disappears and the main role in the treatment process It plays only a field , an information component , which contains information on medicinal properties of the drug . Due to special structural and informational the properties of water, all this information about the medicinal properties is remembered on it drug .

According to the observations of these authors , each subsequent dilution and Shaking, increases the number of active clusters , contained in the volume , thereby increasing , from potency to potency , therapeutic activity drug . The same effect is obtained with non-contact exposure to water. field structure , comprising a medical information . Experiments have shown , that two variants of the same remedy , at different potencies , differ from each other by the intensity , not the frequency of the background radiation . Received the result refutes the " frequency " hypothesis that, as a result, potentiation changes only the natural frequency of radiation of drugs .

13. Transfer of medicinal properties of drugs to large distance

By . t . n . Mark Greenstein and Ph . m . n . Michael Shraybmanom a system , providing the ability to transmit via wireless and cable communication lines , for example , cellular communication and the Internet , information - wave properties of substances biological objects , including medicinal properties of medicines and medicinal plants , as well as information about the functional state of the body humans and animals . The system , based on the method of bio-resonance therapy ( Voll method ), can be used to create unparalleled in the world emergency telemedicine network .

14. Computer light - color brain stimulation

A member of our association, Ph . t . n . Sh . Baskin proposed a method and a set of programs light - linguistic medicine for effective treatment , health prevention and enhancing human creativity . The method is based on known evidence of the amazing healing and prophylactic properties of Jewish holy texts and at the discovery of visual images of Hebrew and Aramite . Unlike existing technical devices for sound and light stimulation of the brain type of light - sound machine "Mind machines" are offered computer program light stimulation of the brain by the original method , developed by by the firm "Wezit". The technique and the program turns the computer into a powerful and flexible brain stimulation and energy massage tool , safer and much cheaper , than the above mentioned technical means .
